# Fullstack Probe

'ello there! These are the projects I created in the process of learning fullstack development.

1. Employee record management [MERN stack]

-> very barebones, doesn't even have client side validation (might change later), basically copied word for word from a [tutorial](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nKWREmCvsE>), but i thought this was a good way to get my feet wet. I might go on and improve some things as i continue learning.
